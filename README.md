# Heat pump calculators

Open source tools to help with heat pump design and understanding.

### [Heat exchanger 1](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX1.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed flow temperature version.

### [Heat exchanger 2](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX2.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Improved fixed heat output version.

### [Low loss header](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/LLH.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a low loss header between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed heat output.

### [SCOP calculator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/SCOP.html)

Calculate heat pump SCOP based on design flow temperature.

### [Dynamic heat pump simulator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/dynamic_heatpump_v1.html)

Explore continuous vs intermittent heating, temperature set-backs and schedules.
