# Heat pump calculators

Open source tools to help with heat pump design and understanding.

### Heat exchanger 1

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed flow temperature version.

### Heat exchanger 2

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Improved fixed heat output version.

### Low loss header

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a low loss header between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed heat output.

### SCOP calculator

Calculate heat pump SCOP based on design flow temperature.

### Dynamic heat pump simulator

Explore continuous vs intermittent heating, temperature set-backs and schedules.
